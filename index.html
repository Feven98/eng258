        <h1 class="overview1">Overview</h1>
        <h3 class="overview2">Harlem Renaissance was a significant cultural and artistic movement that emerged in the
          early 20th century, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York
          City. This period marked a pivotal moment in African American history and literature, characterized by a surge
          of creativity, intellectualism, and cultural expression among Black artists, writers, musicians, and thinkers.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="overview3">- There are three defining characteristics that makes Harlem Renaissance different from
          the others period. </h3>
      
      <div class="character">
        <h3>A. Great Migration of African Americans from rural to urban spaces and from South to North</h3>
        <p>It was a significant movement of African Americans from the rural South to urban areas in the North of the
          United States during the early 1900s to 1970s. Many Black people left the South to escape racism, poverty, and
          limited opportunities, seeking better jobs and a chance for a better life in Northern cities. This migration
          led to major changes in demographics, as cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit saw an increase in Black
          populations. It also brought about a cultural renaissance known as the Harlem Renaissance, with Black artists
          and writers flourishing in urban centers. Despite facing discrimination and challenges in their new homes, the
          Great Migration had a lasting impact on African American culture, civil rights, and urban life in America.</p>
        <h3>B. Artistic Expression and Creativity</h3>
        <p>It encompass the diverse ways individuals or communities use art forms like painting, sculpture, literature,
          music, dance, and theater to communicate emotions, ideas, and experiences. Artists employ originality and
          skill to convey personal perspectives or cultural themes, contributing to cultural innovation and enriching
          society with unique artistic expressions. Through creativity, artists explore new techniques, challenge
          conventions, and address important issues, connecting with audiences on emotional and intellectual levels
          while expressing their identities and perspectives.</p>
        <h3>C. Cultural Empowerment and Economic Opportunity</h3>
        <p>It refers to efforts to strengthen African American culture and promote pride while also creating better jobs
          and economic opportunities. During movements like the Harlem Renaissance, artists and writers celebrated Black
          culture to combat stereotypes and empower the community. At the same time, initiatives like the Great
          Migration aimed to improve job prospects and living conditions for African Americans in Northern cities.
          Despite challenges, these efforts sought to provide pathways to economic success through education and civil
          rights activism. Together, these initiatives fostered empowerment and progress within the African American
          community.</p>
